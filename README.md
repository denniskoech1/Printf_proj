# ALX printf Project
- This repository is a replication of the standard library printf function in C. This is the first project in the alx low-level programming sprint.

-The function `_printf` writes output to stdout. The function writes under the control of a `format` string that specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of standard library `stdarg`) are converted for output.

- Upon success, `_printf` returns the number of characters printed (**excluding the terminating null byte used to end output to strings**). If an output error is encountered, the function returns `-1`.
